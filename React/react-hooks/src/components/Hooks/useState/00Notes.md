# What is UseState?

> useState is a special function in React that lets you add state (or data) to a functional component. Think of state as a way to keep track of things that can change, like a number, a text input, or a list.

# Why Use useState?

> In a React app, your components can show different things based on user actions. For example, you might want to keep track of how many times a button is clicked. useState helps you do that!

> The useState hook allows you to add state to functional components. It's a fundamental part of managing local component state in React.

# Basic Syntax

> const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

> state: This is the current value of the state.

> setState: This is a function you use to update the state.

> initialState: This is the value that the state starts with.

# Breakdown of useState

1. Importing useState: You import useState from React.

2. Declaring State: You call useState with an initial state value (in this case, 0). It returns an array with two elements:

> The current state value (count).

> A function to update the state (setCount).

3.  Using State: You can display the state value in your component (here, {count}) and update it using the setCount function.

4. Event Handling: When the button is clicked, it calls the setCount function to increment the count.

# Rules

1. Call useState at the Top Level

> Donâ€™t call useState inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Always use it at the top level of your component to ensure that React can manage state properly.

2. Use It in Functional Components Only

> useState can only be used in functional components or custom hooks, not in class components. If you're using a class component, you'll need to use this.state and this.setState.

3. State Initialization

> You can pass an initial state value to useState. This value can be anything: a number, string, array, or object

> You can also pass a function to initialize the state if the initial value is expensive to compute. This function will only run on the first render.

4. Use the State Updater Function

> Always use the updater function to change state. This ensures that React knows when to re-render your component.

> For updates based on the previous state, use a functional update: This helps avoid issues with stale state


6. Group State as Needed

> You can group related state into a single state object if it makes sense. This can help manage complex state more easily.


# Summary

> Call useState at the top level of your component.

> Use it only in functional components or custom hooks.

> Initialize state with a value or a function.

> Use the updater function to change state.

> Remember that state updates are asynchronous.

> Group related state together if needed.
