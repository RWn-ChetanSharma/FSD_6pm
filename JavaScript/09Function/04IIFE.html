    <h1>IIFE Function</h1>
    <p>
      A JavaScript IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function
      that runs the moment it is invoked or called in the JavaScript event loop.
      Having a function that behaves that way can be useful for several use
      cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a powerful tool in
      JavaScript for encapsulating code, avoiding global scope pollution, and
      providing data privacy. By understanding and utilizing IIFE in your code,
      you can write more modular and maintainable JavaScript applications.
