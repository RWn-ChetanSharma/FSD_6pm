    <h1>Closure In JS</h1>
    <p>
      A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
      with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In
      other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from
      an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a
      function is created, at function creation time.
    </p>

    <p>
      A function bundled together with its lexical environment makes a closure
    </p>

    <p>
      What's much more interesting, a nested function can be returned: either as
      a property of a new object or as a result by itself. It can then be used
      somewhere else. No matter where, it still has access to the same outer
      variables.

    <script>
        let c = 40
      function outerOuter() {
        let b = 30;
        console.log(c);
        
        function outer() {
          let a = 20;
          console.log(b);

          function inner() {
            console.log(a);
          }
          inner();
        }
        outer();
      }
      outerOuter();
    </script>
  </body>
