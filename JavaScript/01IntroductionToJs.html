    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a Event Based Programming Language</p>
    <p>
      The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written
      right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript is a prototype-based Language</li>
      <li>JavaScript is a Synchoronous single-threaded Language</li>
      <li>JavaScript is a supporting object-oriented Language</li>
      <li>
        Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
      </li>
      <li>
        React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
      </li>
      <li>Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.</li>
      <li>Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or
      actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript
      engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual
      machine”.
    </p>

    <p>Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.</li>
      <li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
      <li>
        There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”,
        “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
