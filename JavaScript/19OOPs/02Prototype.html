    <h1>Prototype</h1>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, a prototype is an object that contains properties and
      methods that are shared by all instances of a particular object. It's a
      reference to another object that's used when a property or method is
      called on an object
    </p>

    <script>
      function BankAccount(customerName, balance = 0) {
        this.customerName = customerName;
        this.accountNumber = Date.now();
        this.balance = balance;

        BankAccount.prototype.deposit = (amount) => {
          this.balance = this.balance + amount;
        };

        BankAccount.prototype.withdraw = (amount) => {
          this.balance = this.balance - amount;
        };
      }

      const vinitAccount = new BankAccount("Vinit", 5000);
      const anshuAccount = new BankAccount("Anshu", 4000);

      console.log(vinitAccount, anshuAccount);

     anshuAccount.deposit(200);
